# SuperChat Frontend Challenge

## Getting started

Execute `yarn start` / `npm run start` to run the project locally.

The project is currently also hosted at https://superchat-challenge-brg.web.app/.

Linting is included through `eslint` (run `yarn lint` or `yarn lint:fix`). No automated testing.

Based on `create-react-app`.

## Using the app

1. Enter a GitHub username in the first input field.
2. Enter a repository name belonging to that GitHub user in the second input field.
3. Select a color and an icon.
4. Generate the link and check it out!

## CSS Modules

Regarding using CSS modules, I have avoided it in this project, since Styled-Components avoids the problem of clashing stylesheets.
